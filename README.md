## About Me ##
 I'm an artist, designer, photographer and UF student. I enjoy spending time with my children, gardening and learning new things. 
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have minimum coding experience. I took a web design course a few years ago, but I don't remember much of it. The most coding I've done was as a teenager customizing my myspace profile. Yes, I'm that old.
## Career Goals ##
 
    1. Become a UX designer.
    2. Design websites that are   easier to use and navigate.
    3. Design websites that make learning and navigation easier for learning disabled students 
       in online learning environments.
